# Clerk Migration Plan

## Phase 0 ‚Äì Foundations & Access
- Provision Clerk instances (dev/staging/prod) with required sign-in methods: email + password, magic link, Google, Facebook, Apple.
- Enable audit logs, data residency, TOTP + SMS MFA factors in Clerk dashboard.
- Generate and store environment variables (`CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, etc.) in env templates.
- Document OAuth provider setup in Clerk (redirect URIs, scopes).

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Database & Model Prep
- Migration 1: add `clerk_user_id TEXT UNIQUE`, `legacy_google_id TEXT`, `password_reset_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` to `users`. Copy existing `google_id` to `legacy_google_id` and allow `google_id` to be nullable.
- Migration 2: create `users_mfa_status` table with MFA status enum (`pending`, `grace`, `required`, `enrolled`) and timestamps.
- Update `backend/src/db/queries/users.ts` to expose helpers for lookup by `clerk_user_id` and manage MFA status flags.
- ‚úÖ Implemented in repo (2025-10-23). Requires running latest DB migration locally (`npm run db:migrate --workspace=backend`) so new columns/table exist.

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Clerk Backfill & Flagging
- Implement `backend/scripts/backfill-clerk-users.ts` to upsert all users into Clerk via Management API.
- For each user: create/sync Clerk user, attach OAuth identity when `legacy_google_id` exists, set `password_reset_required` in both Clerk and local DB.
- Mirror local roles into Clerk `publicMetadata.roles`.
- Run script with dry-run mode in dev, then apply in staging, and finally prod during maintenance window.
- ‚úÖ Script scaffolded (`backend/scripts/backfill-clerk-users.ts`); dry-run by default, use `--apply` when ready. Handles role metadata + password-reset flag. OAuth identity linking still pending (will require dedicated flow once Clerk tokens are available).
- ‚úÖ Added `backend/scripts/mark-clerk-google-relink.ts` to flag accounts missing Clerk Google OAuth, plus `docs/clerk-google-relink.md` describing the re-link rollout plan.

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Dual-Auth Bridge (Temporary)
- Introduce middleware that accepts legacy sessions/mobile tokens or Clerk tokens.
- When legacy auth is detected, create a Clerk session (`clerkClient.sessions.create`) and mark user as needing password reset.
- Instrument metrics/logging to measure remaining legacy traffic.
- üîÑ In progress: Backend now mints Clerk sessions during mobile login, bearer middleware + Socket.IO accept Clerk JWTs, and bridge events are logged; metrics aggregation/dashboarding still TBD.

## Phase 4 ‚Äì Backend Session Refactor
- Replace Express session + Passport with Clerk middleware (`ClerkExpressWithAuth`).
- Update controllers/services to resolve local users via `clerk_user_id` and attach to `req.user`.
- Update Socket.IO auth to validate Clerk session JWTs.
- Deprecate `mobileTokenService` issuance while bridge is active; keep verification until cutover.
- ‚úÖ Prep work: Bearer + Socket.IO already honor Clerk tokens; metrics/logging in place.
- Next steps:
  1. Introduce Clerk Express middleware alongside existing session handling (feature flag).
  2. Gradually swap legacy `req.user` population to rely on Clerk context when available.
  3. Once parity confirmed, remove Express session + Passport wiring and retire legacy login tokens.

## Phase 5 ‚Äì Mobile App Migration
- Integrate Clerk Expo SDK with hosted components.
- Wrap app in `ClerkProvider` and update API client to send Clerk session tokens.
- Remove legacy mobile login flow and ensure SecureStore still holds app-specific secrets.

## Phase 6 ‚Äì Web Frontend (if applicable)
- Replace existing web auth UI with Clerk hosted sign-in/up components.
- Ensure API calls use Clerk session tokens.

## Phase 7 ‚Äì Google Sync & Integrations Alignment
- Resolve Google credential ownership via `clerk_user_id` ‚Üí local `user.id`.
- Enforce MFA grace policy before allowing Google OAuth linking.
- Confirm encryption/storage remain unchanged and cleanup cascades on user deletion.

## Phase 8 ‚Äì Testing & Validation
- Update backend tests to mock Clerk auth context and cover MFA grace logic.
- Adjust contract and mobile tests to operate with Clerk tokens.
- Manual QA checklist: login flows, password reset, MFA enrollment, Google calendar sync, realtime sockets, contributor invites.
- ‚úÖ Smoke test complete: Clerk session tokens authenticate REST + Socket.IO; metrics confirm `auth.bridge.http/socket` paths. Re-link script dry run flagged legacy users.
- üìù Next: migrate controllers to rely on Clerk context, then retire legacy sessions (Phase 4).

## Phase 9 ‚Äì Cutover & Cleanup
- Schedule maintenance window; deploy backend changes, run migrations, execute backfill script.
- Release mobile build with Clerk integration; coordinate rollout.
- Remove bridge middleware, drop `google_id`, delete `user_sessions` table if unused, and retire legacy auth code.
- Update documentation, env templates, and communicate MFA grace expectations.
